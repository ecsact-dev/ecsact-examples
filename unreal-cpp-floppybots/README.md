# Ecsact Floppybots Example

A proof-of-concept demo showing off entity streaming, Ecsact with Mass Entity, and how you can use the Ecsact Unreal plugin. Executable with both sync and async runtimes.

## Getting Started

This demo relies on two Unreal plugins as well as the [Ecsact SDK](https://ecsact.dev/start):

* Ecsact - <https://github.com/ecsact-dev/ecsact_unreal/releases>
* EcsactNet - <https://github.com/seaube/ecsact-net-unreal/releases>

These plugins should be installed as engine plugins in the marketplace folder. For example:

```
<Unreal-Install-Dir>/Plugins/Marketplace/Ecsact
<Unreal-Install-Dir>/Plugins/Marketplace/EcsactNet
```
