# Basic Ecsact Unreal Example

Simply increments a counter using an Ecsact system.

**NOTE**: The `EcsactRuntime.dll` is pre-built and commited to this repo. That means if you edit the `.ecsact` file it will not be re-built. If you'd like to build it yourself please go to:

```
Project Settings -> Ecsact -> Enable Build
```

## Requirements

* Unreal 5.5
* Ecsact Unreal Plugin (soon to be on Fab)
* [Ecsact SDK](https://ecsact.dev/start) >= 0.9.0
