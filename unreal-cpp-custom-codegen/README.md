# Unreal Ecsact Custom Codegen Plugin

This repository shows you how to make your own Escact codegen plugin and use it in your Unreal project.

The codegen plugin will create a `UCLASS` that extends `AActor` for every component in your `.ecsact` files. Not a very useful plugin, but it should demonstrate how to access components and generate code from the details.
